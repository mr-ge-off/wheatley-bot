# wheatley-bot
A shitty bot for our shitty discord.

This bot is built using Python3.  It currently has the following dependencies, available via `pip`:
|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|[`discord`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)|A Python 3 implementation of Discord's API
|[`emoji`](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/)|A small libarary for quickly finding emoji for reactions|

It's a lazy WIP, and I'll get to it when I get to it.
